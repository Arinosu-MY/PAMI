# Mining Spatial(Neighbourhood) Weighted Frequent Patterns in Spatiotemporal Databases

## 1. What is spatial weighted frequent pattern mining?

weighted Frequent neighbourhood pattern mining aims to discover all interesting patterns in a transactional database that have **weighted sum** no less than the user-specified **minimum weighted sum** (**minWS**) constraint, and **dist** no greater than the user-specified **maximum distance (_maxDist_)**.  The **minWS** controls the minimum number of transactions that a pattern must appear in a database. The **minWeight** controls the minimum weight of item. The **maxDist** controls the maximum distance between two items.<br>

## 2. What is the transactional weighted database?

A transactional database is a collection of transactions, where each transaction contains a transaction-identifier and a set of items and its respective weights. <br> A hypothetical transactional database containing the items **_a, b, c, d, e, f, and g_** as shown below

|tid| Transactions| Weights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | a b f g | 20 15 20 20 |
| 2 | a c f g | 5 30 20 10 |
| 3 | d f g | 30 20 15|
| 4 | b c d | 60 80 10 |
| 5 | b c d e | 60 40 20 5
| 6 | a b c e g | 10 20 45 10 25 |

__Note:__  Duplicate items must not exist in a transaction.

## 3. What is acceptable format of a transactional database with respective weights in PAMI

Each row in a transactional database must contain only items. The frequent pattern mining algorithms in PAMI implicitly assume the row number of a transaction as its transactional-identifier to reduce storage and processing costs. A sample transactional database, say sampleInputFile.txt, is provided below.

a b f g:20 15 20 20 <br>
a c f g:5 30 20 10 <br>
d f g:30 20 15 <br>
b c d:60 80 10 <br>
b c d e:60 40 20 5 <br>
a b c e g:10 20 45 10 25  <br>

## 4. What is a neighborhood database? 

A neighborhood database contains items and their neighbors. An item *x* is said to be a neighbor of *y* if the distance between *x* and *y* is no more than the user-specified *maximum distance* threshold value.<br>

A hypothetical neighborhood database containing the items **_a, b, c, d, e, f and g_** is shown below.

| Items | neighbours |
| --- | --- |
| a | b, c, e |
| b | a, d, e |
| c | a, d, e | 
| d | b, c, e, f |
| e | a, b, c, d |
| f | d, g |
| g | f |

The methodology to create a neighborhood database file from a given geo-referenced database has been described in the manual [creatingNeighborhoodFile.pdf](creatingNeighborhoodFile.pdf)

## 5. What is the acceptable format of a spatial database?

The format of the neighborhood database is similar to that of a transactional database. That is, each transaction must contain a set of items. In a transaction, the first item represents the key item, while the remaining items represent the neighbors of the first item. 

A sample neighborhood file, say [sampleNeighbourFile.txt](sampleNeighbourFile.txt), is provided below:

a b c e <br>
b a d e <br>
c a d e <br>
d b c e f <br>
e a b c d <br>
f d g <br>
g f <br>

## 6. What is the need of understanding the statisctics of transaction weighted database?

To understand about the database. The below code will give the detail about the transactional database.
* Total number of transactions (Database size)
* Total number of unique items in database
* Minimum lenth of transaction that existed in database
* Average length of all transactions that exists in database
* Maximum length of transaction that existed in database
* Standard deviation of transaction length
* Variance in transaction length
* Sparsity of database

The below sample code prints the statistical details of a database.

```python 
import PAMI.extras.dbStats.TransactionalDatabase as stats 
obj = stats.TransactionalDatabase('sampleInputFile.txt', ' ') 
obj.run() 
obj.printStats() 
```

## 7. What are the input parameters to a spatial weighted frequent pattern mining algorithm?

Algorithms to mine the spatial weighted frequent patterns require transactional database with weights, neighborhood database, a user-specified *minSup* constraint and a Algorithms to mine the weighted frequent spatial patterns require transactional database with weights, neighborhood database, a user-specified *minWeight* constraint. Please note that *maxDist* constraint has been used in prior to create a neighborhood database file. 

. Please note that *maxDist* constraint has been used in prior to create a neighborhood database file.
