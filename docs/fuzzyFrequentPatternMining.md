# Mining  Fuzzy Frequent Patterns in Fuzzy Transactional Databases

## 1. What is Fuzzy Frequent pattern mining?

Frequent pattern mining is a renowned data mining technique that aims to discover frequently occurring patterns in a (binary) transactional database. A fundamental limitation of this model is that it fails to discover interesting patterns that may exist in a quantitative (or non-binary) transactional database. When encountered with this limitation in the real-world applications, researchers try to find frequent patterns by converting a quantitative transactional database into a fuzzy transactional database using a set of fuzzy functions. The frequent patterns generated from the fuzzy transactional database are known as **fuzzy frequent patterns**.

Formally, fuzzy frequent pattern mining aims to discover all patterns that satisfy the user-specified **minimum support** (*minsup*) in a fuzzy transactional database. The **minSup** controls the minimum number of transactions that a pattern must appear in a database.

## 2. What is a Fuzzy transactional database?

A fuzzy transactional database is a collection of transactions, where each transaction contains a set of fuzzy items and their respective fuzzy (or probability) values.  Please note that the fuzzy values of a fuzzy item will always lie between (0,1) or (0%, 100%).

Given a quantitative transactional database containing the items,  *a, b, c, d, e, f and g*, and  a set of fuzzy membership labels, Low (L), Medium (M), and High (H), a generated hypothetical fuzzy database is shown below.

| Transactions|                                     
| --- |                                              
| (a.L,0.2) (b.M,0.3) (c.H,0.1) (g.M,0.1) |                          
| (b.M,0.3) (c.H,0.2) (d.L,0.3) (e.H,0.2) |                          
| (a.L,0.2) (b.M,0.1) (c.H,0.3) (d.L,0.4) |                          
| (a.L,0.3) (c.H,0.2) (d.L,0.1) (f.M,0.2) |                          
| (a.L,0.3) (b.M,0.1) (c.H,0.2) (d.L,0.1) (g.M,0.2) |                    
| (c.H,0.2) (d.L,0.2) (e.H,0.3) (f.M,0.1) |                          
| (a.L,0.2) (b.M,0.1) (c.H,0.1) (d.L,0.2) |                          
| (a.L,0.1) (e.H,0.2) (f.M,0.2) |
| (a.L,0.2) (b.M,0.2) (c.H,0.4) (d.L,0.2) |
| (b.M,0.3) (c.H,0.2) (d.L,0.2) (e.H,0.2) |

__Note:__  Duplicate items must not exist in a transaction.

## 3. What is acceptable format of a fuzzy transactional database in PAMI?

Each row in a fuzzy transactional database must contain list of fuzzy items, colon as a seperator, and their list of fuzzy values. <br>
- Colon ':' must be used as a seperator to distinguish fuzzy items and their fuzzy values. This seperator is fixed and cannot be over-written by the users.
- fuzzy items and fuzzy values have to be seperated from each other with a delimitar. The default delimitar is 'tab space,' however, users can over-ride this default seperator.

A sample fuzzy transactional database file, say [fuzzyTransactionalDatabase.txt](fuzzyTransactionalDatabase.txt), is provided below:

a.L b.M c.H g.M:0.2 0.3 0.1 0.1 <br>
b.M c.H d.L e.H:0.13 0.2 0.3 0.2 <br>
a.L b.M c.H d.L:0.2 0.1 0.3 0.4 <br>
a.L c.H d.L f.M:0.3 0.2 0.1 0.2 <br>
a.L b.M c.H d.L g.M:0.3 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.2 <br>
c.H d.L e.H f.M:0.2 0.2 0.3 0.1 <br>
a.L b.M c.H d.L:0.2 0.1 0.1 0.2 <br>
a.L e.H f.M:0.1 0.2 0.2 <br>
a.L b.M c.H d.H:0.2 0.2 0.4 0.2 <br>
b.M c.H d.L e.H:0.3 0.2 0.2 0.2 <br>

## 4. What is the need for understanding the statistics of a fuzzy transactional database?

The performance of a pattern mining algorithm primarily depends on the satistical nature of a database. Thus, it is important to know the following details of a database:
* Total number of transactions (Database size)
* Total number of unique items in database
* Minimum lenth of transaction that existed in database
* Average length of all transactions that exists in database
* Maximum length of transaction that existed in database
* Standard deviation of transaction length
* Variance in transaction length
* Sparsity of database

The below sample code prints the statistical details of a database.

```python
import PAMI.extras.dbStats.FuzzyDatabase as stats

obj = stats.FuzzyDatabase('fuzzyTransactionalDatabase.txt', ' ')
obj.run()
obj.printStats() 
```

## 5. What are the input parameters to be specified for a fuzzy frequent pattern mining algorithm?

The input parameters to a fuzzy frequent pattern mining algorithm are: 

* __Fuzzy transactional database__  <br> Acceptable formats:
> * String : E.g., 'fuzzyDatabase.txt'
> * URL  : E.g., https://u-aizu.ac.jp/~udayrage/datasets/fuzzyDatabases/fuzzy_T10I4D100K.csv
> * DataFrame with the header titled 'Transactions' and 'fuzzyValues'

* __minSup__  <br> specified in 
> * __count (beween 0 to length of a database)__ or 
> * [0, 1]
* __seperator__ <br> default seperator is '\t' (tab space)

## 6. How to store the output of a fuzzy frequent pattern mining algorithm?
The patterns discovered by a fuzzy frequent pattern mining algorithm can be saved into a file or a data frame.

## 7. How to run a fuzzy frequent pattern mining algorithms in a terminal?
