# Mining High-Utility Spatial Patterns in Utility Databases

## 1. What is High-Utility Spatial pattern mining?

High utility pattern mining aims to discover all the patterns with utility of pattern is no less than user-specified **_minimum utility_** threshold **_minutil_** and no distance between any two of its items should be no greater than user-specified **_maximum distance_**.

## 2. What is a utility database?

A utility database is a collection of transaction, where each transaction contains a set of items and a positive integer called **_internal utility_** respectively. And each unique item in database is also associated with another positive number called **_external utility_** for each transaction. <br>
A hypothetical utility database with items **_a, b, c, d, e, f and g_** and its **_internal utility_** is shown below at right side and items with its **_external utilities_** for each transaction is presented at left side.

| Transactions                  | external utilities |
|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| (a,2) (b,3) (c,1) (g,1)       | 5 4 3 2            |
| (b,3) (c,2) (d,3) (e,2)       | 5 2 9 3            |
| (a,2) (b,1) (c,3) (d,4)       | 2 3 5 6            |
| (a,3) (c,2) (d,1) (f,2)       | 1 3 4 6            |
| (a,3) (b,1) (c,2) (d,1) (g,2) | 2 5 3 6 1          |
| (c,2) (d,2) (e,3) (f,1)       | 2 3 4 5            |
| (a,2) (b,1) (c,1) (d,2)       | 5 4 3 2            |
| (a,1) (e,2) (f,2)             | 4 8 3              |
| (a,2) (b,2) (c,4) (d,2)       | 7 4 9 8            |
| (b,3) (c,2) (d,2) (e,2)       | 5 9 10 24          |

__Note:__  Duplicate items must not exist in a transaction.

## 3. What is the acceptable format of a utility database in PAMI?

Each row in a utility database must contain only items, total sum of utilties and utility values. A sample transactional database, say sampleInputFile.txt, is provided below. <br>

A sample utility database, say [sampleUtilitySpatial.txt](sampleUtilitySpatial.txt), is provided below.

a b c g:7:2 3 1 1:5 4 3 2   <br>
b c d e:10:3 2 3 2:5 2 9 3  <br>
a b c d:10:2 1 3 4:2 3 5 6  <br>
a c d f:7:3 2 1 2:1 3 4 6   <br>
a b c d g:9:3 1 2 1 2:2 5 3 6 1   <br>
c d e f:8:2 2 3 1:2 3 4 5   <br>
a b c d:6:2 1 1 2:5 4 3 2   <br>
a e f:5:1 2 2:4 8 3         <br>
a b c d:10:2 2 4 2:7 4 9 8  <br>
b c d e:9:3 2 2 2:5 9 10 24  <br>

## 4. What is a neighbourhood database? 

A neighborhood database contains items and their neighbors. An item *x* is said to be a neighbor of *y* if the distance between *x* and *y* is no more than the user-specified *maximum distance* threshold value.<br>
A hypothetical spatial database containing items **_a, b, c, d, e, f and g_** and neighbours respectively is shown below.

| Items | neighbours |
| --- | --- |
| a | b, c, d |
| b | a, e, g |
| c | a, d | 
| d | a, c |
| e | b, f |
| f | e, g |
| g | b, f |

The methodology to create a neighborhood database file from a given geo-referenced database has been described in the manual [creatingNeighborhoodFile.pdf](creatingNeighborhoodFile.pdf)

## 5. What is the acceptable format of a neighborhood database?

The format of the neighborhood database is similar to that of a transactional database. That is, each transaction must contain a set of items. In a transaction, the first item represents the key item, while the remaining items represent the neighbors of the first item. 

A sample neighborhood file, say [sampleNeighbourFile.txt](sampleNeighbourFile.txt), is provided below:

a b c d <br>
b a e g<br>
c a d<br>
d a c<br>
e b f<br>
f e g<br>
g b f <br>

## 6. What is the need for understanding the statistics of a utility database?

The performace of a pattern mining algorithm primarily depends on the satistical nature of a database. Thus, it is important to know the following details of a database: 
* Total number of transactions (Database size)
* Total number of unique items in database
* Minimum lenth of transaction that existed in database
* Average length of all transactions that exists in database
* Maximum length of transaction that existed in database
* Minimum utility value exists in database
* Average utility exists in database
* Maximum utility exists in database
* Standard deviation of transaction length
* Variance in transaction length
* Sparsity of database

The below sample code prints the statistical details of a database.

```python
import PAMI.extras.dbStats.UtilityDatabase as stats

obj = stats.UtilityDatabase('sampleInputFile.txt', ' ')
obj.run()
obj.printStats() 
```

## 7. What are the input parameters to a high utility spatial pattern mining algorithm?

Algorithms to mine the high utility spatial patterns require utility database, neighborhood database, and a user-specified *minUtil* constraint. Please note that *maxDist* constraint has been used in prior to create a neighborhood database file.

* __Utility database__  <br> Acceptable formats:
> * String : E.g., 'utilityDatabase.txt'
> * URL  : E.g., https://u-aizu.ac.jp/~udayrage/datasets/transactionalDatabases/transactional_T10I4D100K.csv
> * DataFrame with the header titled 'Transactions', 'Utility' and 'TransactionUtility'

* __Spatial database__  <br> Acceptable formats:
> * String : E.g., 'spatialDatabase.txt'
> * URL  : E.g., https://u-aizu.ac.jp/~udayrage/datasets/transactionalDatabases/transactional_T10I4D100K.csv
> * DataFrame with the header titled 'item' and 'Neighbours'

* __minUtil__  <br> specified in 
> * __count__
* __seperator__ <br> default seperator is '\t' (tab space)

## 8.How to store the output of a frequent pattern mining algorithm?
The patterns discovered by a high utility spatial pattern mining algorithm can be saved into a file or a data frame.

## 9. How to execute a high utility spatial pattern mining algorithm in a terminal?

* Download the PAMI source code from [Github](https://github.com/udayRage/PAMI/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)..
* Unzip the PAMI source code folder.
* Enter into highUtilitySpatialPattern folder.
```console

```


__Example:__ python3 `HDSHUIM.py` `inputFile.txt` `outputFile.txt` `neighbourFile.txt` $20$ &nbsp; `' '`

## 10. How to execute a high utility spatial pattern mining algorithm in a Jupyter Notebook?

- Install the PAMI package from the PYPI repository by executing the following command:   **pip3 install PAMI**
* Run the below sample code by making necessary changes


```python

iFile = 'sampleUtilitySpatial.txt'  #specify the input utility database
nFile = 'sampleNeighbourFile.txt'      #specify the neighbour file of database 
minUtil = 20                        #specify the minUtil value 
seperator = ' ' #specify the seperator. Default seperator is tab space. 
oFile = 'utilityPatterns.txt'   #specify the output file name

obj = alg.HDSHUIM(iFile, nFile, minUtil, seperator) #initialize the algorithm
obj.mine()                       #start the mining process
obj.save(oFile)               #store the patterns in file
df = obj.getPatternsAsDataFrame()     #Get the patterns discovered into a dataframe
obj.printResults()                      #Print the stats of mining process
```
