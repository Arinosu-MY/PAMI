# Mining Fuzzy Periodic-Frequent Patterns in Fuzzy Temporal Databases

## 1. What is fuzzy periodic-frequent pattern mining?

The fuzzy frequent pattern model aims to discover frequently occurring patterns in a fuzzy transactional database. This model implicitly assumes that the temporal occurrence information of the transactions, if any, will not affect the interestingness of a pattern to the user. However, this is seldom not the case in many real-world applications. In many applications, the user may consider a pattern occurring at periodic intervals to be more interesting than a pattern occur at aperiodic (or irregular) intervals. With this motivation, the fuzzy frequent pattern model was generalized to discover fuzzy periodic-frequent patterns in a fuzzy temporal database.

The basic model of fuzzy periodic-frequent pattern aims  to discover all patterns in a fuzzy temporal database that satisfy the user-specified   **minimum support** (**minSup**) constraint and **maximum periodicity** (**maxPer**) constraints.  The **minSup** controls the minimum number of transactions that a pattern must appear in a database. The **maxPer** controls the maximum time interval within which a pattern must reappear in the database.

## 2. What is a fuzzy temporal database?

A fuzzy temporal database is a collection of transactions at a particular timestamp, where each transaction contains a timestamp, set of items, and its fuzzy values respectively. <br> A hypothetical fuzzy temporal database containing the items **_a, b, c, d, e, f, and g_** as shown below

|TS| Transactions|                                     
| --- | --- |                                          
| 1| (a.L,0.2) (b.M,0.3) (c.H,0.1) (g.M,0.1) |                          
| 2|(b.M,0.3) (c.H,0.2) (d.L,0.3) (e.H,0.2)|                          
| 3|(a.L,0.2) (b.M,0.1) (c.H,0.3) (d.L,0.4)|                          
| 4|(a.L,0.3) (c.H,0.2) (d.L,0.1) (f.M,0.2)|                          
| 5|(a.L,0.3) (b.M,0.1) (c.H,0.2) (d.L,0.1) (g.M,0.2)|                    
| 6|(c.H,0.2) (d.L,0.2) (e.H,0.3) (f.M,0.1)|                          
| 7|(a.L,0.2) (b.M,0.1) (c.H,0.1) (d.L,0.2) |                        
| 8|(a.L,0.1) (e.H,0.2) (f.M,0.2) |
| 9|(a.L,0.2) (b.M,0.2) (c.H,0.4) (d.L,0.2)|
| 10|(b.M,0.3) (c.H,0.2) (d.L,0.2) (e.H,0.2) |

__Note:__  Duplicate items must not exist in a transaction.

## 3. What is acceptable format of a fuzzy temporal database in PAMI?

Each row in a fuzzy temporal database must contain timeStamp, list of fuzzy items, colon as a seperator, and their list of fuzzy values. <br>
- Colon ':' must be used as a seperator to distinguish fuzzy items and their fuzzy values. This seperator is fixed and cannot be over-written by the users.
- fuzzy items and fuzzy values have to be seperated from each other with a delimitar. The default delimitar is 'tab space,' however, users can over-ride this default seperator.
- There is no need for a seperator to distinct timestamp and fuzzy items. The first element in a transaction is considered as a timestamp by default. 

A sample fuzzy temporal database file, say [fuzzyTemporalDatabase.txt](fuzzyTemporalDatabase.txt), is provided below:

1 a.L b.M c.H g.M:0.2 0.3 0.1 0.1 <br>
2 b.M c.H d.L e.H:0.13 0.2 0.3 0.2 <br>
3 a.L b.M c.H d.L:0.2 0.1 0.3 0.4 <br>
4 a.L c.H d.L f.M:0.3 0.2 0.1 0.2 <br>
5 a.L b.M c.H d.L g.M:0.3 0.1 0.2 0.1 0.2 <br>
6 c.H d.L e.H f.M:0.2 0.2 0.3 0.1 <br>
7 a.L b.M c.H d.L:0.2 0.1 0.1 0.2 <br>
8 a.L e.H f.M:0.1 0.2 0.2 <br>
9 a.L b.M c.H d.H:0.2 0.2 0.4 0.2 <br>
10 b.M c.H d.L e.H:0.3 0.2 0.2 0.2 <br>

## 4. What is the need for understanding the statistics of a database?

The performance of a pattern mining algorithm primarily depends on the satistical nature of a database. Thus, it is important to know the following details of a database: 

* Total number of transactions (Database size)
* Total number of unique items in database
* Minimum lenth of transaction that existed in database
* Average length of all transactions that exists in database
* Maximum length of transaction that existed in database
* Standard deviation of transaction length
* Variance in transaction length
* Sparsity of database

The below sample code prints the statistical details of a database.

```python
import PAMI.extras.dbStats.FuzzyDatabase as stats

obj = stats.FuzzyDatabase('fuzzyTemporalDatabase.txt', ' ')
obj.run()
obj.printStats() 
```

## 5. What are the input parameters to be specified for a fuzzy periodic-frequent pattern mining algorithm?

* __Fuzzy Temporal database__  <br> Acceptable formats:
> * String : E.g., 'fuzzyDatabase.txt'
> * URL  : E.g., https://u-aizu.ac.jp/~udayrage/datasets/fuzzyDatabases/fuzzyTemporal_T10I4D100K.csv
> * DataFrame with the header titled 'Transactions' and 'fuzzyValues'

* __minSup__  <br> specified in
> * __count (beween 0 to length of a database)__ or
> * [0, 1]
* __maxPer__  <br> specified in 
> * __count (beween 0 to length of a database)__ or
> * [0, 1]
* __seperator__ <br> default seperator is '\t' (tab space)

## 6. How to store the output of a fuzzy periodic-frequent patternn mining algorithm?
The patterns discovered by a fuzzy periodic frequent pattern mining algorithm can be saved into a file or a data frame.
